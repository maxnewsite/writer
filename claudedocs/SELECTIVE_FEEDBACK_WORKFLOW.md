## Detailed Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Write or Generate Chapter

**Option A: Manual Writing**
- Type your chapter content in the editor
- Aim for at least 500 words for meaningful feedback

**Option B: AI Generation**
- Click "🤖 AI Workflow"
- Click "Generate Initial Draft"
- Wait ~2-4 minutes for AI to write in sections

### Step 2: Open AI Feedback Panel

1. Click the **"💡 AI Feedback"** button in toolbar
2. The panel slides in from the right
3. You'll see instructions on how it works

### Step 3: Generate AI Reader Feedback

1. Click **"🎭 Generate AI Reader Feedback"**
2. Wait ~2-3 minutes while:
   - 6 AI personas read your chapter
   - Academic asks about theory
   - Practitioner asks about application
   - Skeptic challenges claims
   - Beginner asks for clarification
   - Enthusiast seeks inspiration
   - Expert looks for depth
3. Each persona generates 2 questions
4. They vote on the most important ones
5. Total: ~12 questions/discussions

### Step 4: Review Reader Conversations

You'll see a list of all questions, each showing:

**Question Card Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☑ How does this apply to beginners?    │
│                                         │
│ 👤 Alex Kim (Beginner)                 │
│ 👍 5 votes                              │
│ 💬 3 discussions                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What Each Metric Means:**
- **Question text**: What the AI reader wants to know
- **Persona**: Which reader type asked it
- **Votes**: How many AI readers found it important
- **Discussions**: How many follow-up comments it generated

### Step 5: Select Best Conversations

**Individual Selection:**
- Click on any question card to toggle checkbox
- Selected cards highlight in blue
- Deselected cards stay white/gray

**Bulk Selection:**
- Click **"Select All"** to select everything
- Click **"Deselect All"** to clear selections

**Selection Strategy:**
- ✅ Select questions that reveal real gaps
- ✅ Select high-vote questions (popular concerns)

- ❌ Skip questions you already addressed

### Step 6: Rewrite or Publish

**Option A: Rewrite with Selected Feedback**

1. Click **"✏️ Rewrite with Selected (N)"**
   - N shows how many conversations selected
   - Button disabled if nothing selected
2. Wait ~30-60 seconds while AI:
   - Reviews selected questions
   - Identifies gaps and concerns
   - Rewrites chapter to address them
   - Preserves strengths
3. Improved content appears in editor
4. Review the changes
5. Repeat process if needed (generate more feedback on new version)

**Option B: Publish As-Is**

1. Close the AI Feedback panel
2. Click **"📤 Publish Chapter"** in toolbar
3. Chapter saved as published
4. Move to next chapter
5. Repeat entire workflow

## Example Session

### Initial Chapter (600 words)
```markdown
# The Power of Morning Routines

Starting your day right sets the tone for everything that follows.
Many successful people swear by their morning routines...

[Rest of generic content]
```

### AI Readers Generate Questions

After clicking "Generate AI Reader Feedback", you get:

1. ☑ **"How is this different from standard time management advice?"**
   - 👤 Jordan Blake (Skeptic) | 👍 8 votes | 💬 4 discussions

2. ☑ **"What about people who work night shifts or have irregular schedules?"**
   - 👤 Alex Kim (Beginner) | 👍 7 votes | 💬 3 discussions

3. ☐ **"Can you provide research backing these claims?"**
   - 👤 Dr. Sarah Chen (Academic) | 👍 6 votes | 💬 2 discussions

4. ☑ **"What's a specific example of someone who transformed their life with this?"**
   - 👤 Mike Rodriguez (Practitioner) | 👍 9 votes | 💬 5 discussions

5. ☐ **"How does this scale for executives managing teams?"**
   - 👤 Prof. David Martinez (Expert) | 👍 4 votes | 💬 1 discussion

### Writer Selects 3 Questions

You select questions #1, #2, and #4 (unchecked #3 and #5 because less relevant)

### AI Rewrites Chapter

After clicking "Rewrite with Selected (3)", the improved chapter now includes:

```markdown
# The Power of Morning Routines

**Unlike generic time management advice that focuses on scheduling**,
morning routines are about identity creation and energy optimization...

## For Night Owls and Shift Workers

The concept isn't about waking at 5am. It's about having
**your** optimal starting ritual, whether that's at 6pm or 2am...

## Real-World Example: Sarah's Transformation

Sarah, a nurse working rotating shifts, couldn't maintain a fixed
morning routine. Instead, she created a 15-minute "shift-start ritual"
that she performs before each shift begins...
```

**Result**: Chapter now:
- ✅ Distinguishes from time management
- ✅ Addresses non-traditional schedules
- ✅ Includes specific success story
- ❌ Doesn't add unnecessary research citations
- ❌ Doesn't add executive-level scaling (kept focused)

## Selection Strategies

### Strategy 1: Address Top Votes
**When**: Most questions have similar concerns
**How**: Select top 3-5 highest voted questions
**Why**: Focus on what most readers care about

### Strategy 2: Address Confusion Points
**When**: Multiple questions reveal misunderstanding
**How**: Select all questions about the confusing concept
**Why**: Fix fundamental clarity issues

### Strategy 3: Add Missing Examples
**When**: Questions ask "how do I..." or "can you show..."
**How**: Select practical/application questions
**Why**: Make content more actionable

### Strategy 4: Balance Perspectives
**When**: Good mix of beginner, skeptic, expert questions
**How**: Select 1-2 from each persona type
**Why**: Make chapter work for all reader levels

### Strategy 5: Skip Irrelevant
**When**: Some questions go off-topic or too narrow
**How**: Only select questions aligned with chapter goal
**Why**: Stay focused on core message

## Benefits of Selective Feedback

### 1. **Writer Control**
- You decide what feedback matters
- Not forced to address everything
- Maintain your vision

### 2. **Focused Improvements**
- Address real gaps, not hypotheticals
- Avoid scope creep
- Keep chapter coherent

### 3. **Time Efficiency**
- Rewrite only what needs fixing
- Skip irrelevant suggestions
- Faster iterations

### 4. **Quality Over Quantity**
- 3 good improvements > 10 mediocre ones
- Targeted fixes more effective
- Better overall result

### 5. **Learning Loop**
- See which questions recur across chapters
- Understand reader mindset
- Improve future writing

## Comparison: Automatic vs Selective

| Aspect | Automatic (Old) | Selective (New) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Control** | AI decides | You decide |
| **Feedback Used** | All questions | Selected questions |
| **Time** | ~3-4 min | ~3-4 min |
| **Relevance** | May include noise | Only what matters |
| **Iteration** | One-shot | Can refine selection |
| **Best For** | Quick fixes | Quality control |

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ Do's

- **Read all questions first** - Understand full feedback before selecting
- **Select 3-5 questions** - Sweet spot for focused improvement
- **Prioritize high votes** - Popular concerns matter most
- **Look for patterns** - Multiple similar questions = real issue
- **Trust your judgment** - You know your chapter best
- **Iterate deliberately** - One focused pass better than many scattered ones

### ❌ Don'ts

- **Don't select everything** - Leads to unfocused rewrite
- **Don't ignore all feedback** - Defeats the purpose
- **Don't select contradictory questions** - AI will struggle to address both
- **Don't rewrite endlessly** - 1-2 iterations usually enough
- **Don't forget to publish** - Perfect is enemy of done

## Troubleshooting

### No Questions Generated
- **Cause**: Chapter too short or Ollama timeout
- **Fix**: Write at least 500 words, ensure Ollama running

### All Questions Seem Irrelevant
- **Cause**: Chapter unclear or AI personas misunderstood
- **Fix**: Revise chapter for clarity first, then get feedback

### Can't Decide Which to Select
- **Cause**: Too many good questions
- **Fix**: Focus on top 3 by votes, or select by category (clarity, examples, evidence)

### Rewrite Doesn't Address Selected Feedback
- **Cause**: Questions too vague or contradictory
- **Fix**: Select clearer, more specific questions

### Button Says "0 Selected"
- **Cause**: Forgot to check boxes
- **Fix**: Click question cards to select them
